🔔 An application that reminds you of things.

## 💻 How does the app work?
It is very simple. In your tray, on Mac at the top right and on windows at the bottom right, an icon like the electron icon shows up. If you click it, a menu appears. Hit "_Add a timer_" to create a new timer. Fill all the information required and click submit. You have successfully created a timer.

If you want to delete a timer. Click the icon again and hit the name of the timer that you want to delete. Hit "Quit notifier" to stop all timers and the application itself.

🚨 The notifications do not work on Windows machines! This will be fixed in a future version.
