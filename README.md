üîî An application that reminds you of things.

* * *

## üíª How does the app work?
It is very simple. In your tray, on Mac at the top right and on windows at the bottom right, an icon like the icon at the top of this file shows up. If you click it, a menu appears. Hit "_Add a timer_" to create a new timer. Fill in all the information required and click submit. You have successfully created a timer.

If you want to delete a timer. Click the icon again and hit the name of the timer that you want to delete. Hit "Quit notifier" to stop all timers and the application itself.

üö® The notifications do not work on Windows machines! See the note at [Build from source](#%EF%B8%8F-build-form-source)

**Note:** On windows machines the notifications won't work when you build the project from source. To fix this add `node_modules/electron/dist/electron.exe` to your start menu.
